Let's start with defining a little helper class in C++ using the helper function `cppdef`, to make the example more interesting:"

Therefore, we will number the `Integer` classes as we go along, to be able to extend the example as we see fit.\n",

Cppyy takes advantage of this fact to generate bindings on-the-fly. This leads to performance advantages for large libraries with thousands of C++ classes; general distribution advantages since, other than the module cppyy itself, no code depends on any specific version of Python; and it enablers, through the Cling backend, interactive access to C++.\n",
